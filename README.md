# RatingAgency
Repository for personal study.

## Case study
The problem here addressed involves a general rating agency. The system here implemented is meant to be very simple, being responsible solely for receiving a Json file via web (razor generated pages) which contains a insurance proposal, classifying this proposal with respect to some given risk conditions, and storing that information in a database (local database).

## Approaches applied
Each approach here studied will be available in a different Branch:
  - branch "Reflection": in this branch, the reflection strategy will be applied. It will be applied within a factory Type.
  - branch "Factory": in this branch, the switch case approach will be handled by a factory class type
  - branch "base": in this branch, no factory Type will be used.
